<h1>Hello! Welcome To My First HTML Page!</h1>

<p>In this course, I am learning how to structure and create HTML documents. This weeks lesson was on the basic syntax and elements.</p>
<p>My first experience with HTML was on MySpace, creating layouts. Social media and programming have both come a <strong>LONG</strong> way since then!</p>

<p>I am completing this course at <a href="https://www.tri-c.edu/IT" target="_blank">Tri-C</a>.</p>
<p>I look forward to learning as much as I can in this class!</p>
